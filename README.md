## About the site

The site (nponto.github.io) contains 3 pages: the homepage, a page about my current and past projects, and a page detailing my resume. I try to keep all of the pages, including my resume page, up-to-date but if you are interested in receiving the formal version of my resume please reach out to me at njponto99@gmail.com as there is some information left out on the website version.
